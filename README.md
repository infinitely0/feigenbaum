Interactive visualisation of the behaviour of the [logistic
map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map) and its
[bifurcations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory).

This program allows you to change the parameters of the logistic map and view
the resulting graph, as well as explore regions of the bifurcation diagram that
it yields.

Run with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/): `lein run 8000` and view in you
browser at http://localhost:8000.

(I made this just to try out Clojure and D3.)
